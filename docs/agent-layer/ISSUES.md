# Issues

Note: This is an agent-layer memory file. It is primarily for agent use.

## Purpose
Deferred defects, maintainability refactors, technical debt, risks, and engineering concerns. Add an entry only when you are not fixing it now.

## Format
- Insert new entries immediately below `<!-- ENTRIES START -->` (most recent first).
- Keep each entry **3–5 lines**.
- Line 1 starts with `- Issue YYYY-MM-DD <id>:` and a short title.
- Lines 2–5 are indented by **4 spaces** and use `Key: Value`.
- Keep **exactly one blank line** between entries.
- Prevent duplicates: search the file and merge/rewrite instead of adding near-duplicates.
- When fixed, remove the entry from this file.

### Entry template
```text
- Issue YYYY-MM-DD short-slug: Short title
    Priority: Critical | High | Medium | Low. Area: <area>
    Description: <observed problem or risk>
    Next step: <smallest concrete next action>
    Notes: <optional dependencies/constraints>
```

## Open issues

<!-- ENTRIES START -->
- Issue 2026-07-11 human-review-search-seq-scan: Human review search filters cannot use indexes at scale
    Priority: Low. Area: Human review / Performance
    Description: `humanReviewListStatementWithLimit` (src/server/human-review.ts) filters with leading-wildcard `ilike` over `regexp_replace`-stripped HTML columns plus `caller_item_id`/`display_name`, so search scans all of an account's rows; queries are account-scoped via the indexed `account_id`, so this is only a concern for accounts with very large item counts.
    Next step: If per-account item counts grow enough for search latency to matter, add `pg_trgm` expression GIN indexes matching the exact `regexp_replace` expressions (or pre-stripped plain-text columns) via Flyway online-index migrations.
    Notes: Raised by gemini-code-assist review on PR #28.

- Issue 2026-07-11 stripe-webhook-status-contract-migration: Remove the transitional Stripe webhook status column after rollout
    Priority: Low. Area: Billing / Migrations
    Description: The expand migration retains `processing_status` with a `processed` default so the new writer and the prior-release rollback writer remain compatible; the column is redundant after that rollback target is retired.
    Next step: After this release is live and becomes the healthy rollback target for the next release, generate and review a forward contract migration that drops `processing_status`, replaces `agent_outbox_prune_stripe_webhook_events` in the same migration (its body filters on `processing_status`, and plpgsql bodies are not validated at column-drop time), and removes the explicit `processing_status`/`processed_at` write from `insertStripeWebhookEventStatement` in the same change.

- Issue 2026-07-10 billing-checkout-latency: Authenticated Stripe checkout latency is unmeasured after the transaction fix
    Priority: Medium. Area: Billing / Performance
    Description: Checkout's three sequential fresh database transactions were consolidated into one transaction locally, but the previously observed 5–10 second deployed latency has not been re-measured, so Stripe API and hosted page-load time remain unquantified.
    Next step: After the next production deploy, capture one authenticated checkout with Worker tail and browser request timing; add stage-level timing only if the residual delay remains material.
    Notes: Blocked on a production deploy (explicit trigger); restored after review found the verification obligation was dropped without a recorded measurement.

- Issue 2026-07-10 sentry-cli-api-schema-mismatch: Pinned sentry-cli 3.6.0 cannot parse current Sentry API responses
    Priority: Low. Area: Tooling / Observability
    Description: `sentry-cli organizations list` (@sentry/cli 3.6.0) fails with "could not parse JSON response: missing field `requireEmailVerification`". Upstream merged PR #3352 on 2026-07-09 to use the current organization-list endpoint and remove the obsolete field, but it is not in the latest stable release; the operator workaround uses an explicit organization slug.
    Next step: When the next stable @sentry/cli release includes upstream PR #3352, bump package.json/toolchain.json and pnpm-lock.yaml, then re-verify `sentry-cli organizations list` and remove the documented workaround.
    Notes: Production source-map upload is unaffected (the @sentry/nextjs build plugin uploads via debug IDs).
